## Notes
It is all set up, fixed, and ready to launch. Feel free to use it and solve your guided project.

I created the prototype for educational purposes only. Feel free to clone and try.

I challenge you to experience it or even become our coffee machine gun.

All donations will support the near development of new gaming experiences and are shared among contributors.

## Stay in touch & support... 🔫 ☕ ;)
